# BasisUniversalUnityBuild

## This project is obsolete

[KTX-Software-Unity](https://github.com/atteneder/KTX-Software-Unity) is the active successor.

It provides native libraries and C bindings of [KTX-Software](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) for use in Unity (within the [KtxUnity](https://github.com/atteneder/KtxUnity) package).

## Introduction

Toolchains to develop and build native libraries for [BasisUniversalUnity](https://github.com/atteneder/BasisUniversalUnity), a Unity package that allows you to load [Binomial LLC](http://www.binomial.info)'s [Basis Universal texture files](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) into a Unity game engine project.

Note: If you just want to use the [BasisUniversalUnity package](https://github.com/atteneder/BasisUniversalUnity), don't waste your time here. This project is just for building the necessary native libraries.

Special thanks to Binomial and everyone involved in making Basis Universal available!

## Building

Check out this repository and make sure its sub-modules are also cloned.

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- A copy/clone of [BasisUniversalUnity](https://github.com/atteneder/BasisUniversalUnity), since the build installs the libraries into it.

Additional each platform has its own prerequisites (see below).

All platform variants will have an `install` build target, that does the following:

This does the following:

- The final library will be installed to the correct place within `BasisUniversalUnity/Runtime/Plugins`.
- The source code for the transcoder + wrapper is copied to `BasisUniversalUnity/Runtime/Plugins/WebGL`. This way it gets compiled and included when you build the Unity project for WebGL.

### macOS

Needed for macOS Unity Editor and macOS standalone builds.

#### Prerequisites macOS

- Xcode and its command line tools

#### Build for macOS

Open up a terminal and navigate into the repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/BasisUniversalUnityBuild
```

Create a subfolder `build`, enter it and call CMake like this:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Xcode
```

This will generate an Xcode project called `basisu_transcoder.xcodeproj`.

Open it with Xcode and build it (target `ALL_BUILD` or `basisu`).

After this was successful, build the target `install`.

### iOS

#### Prerequisites iOS

- Xcode and its command line tools

#### Build for iOS

Create a subfolder `build_ios`, enter it and call CMake like this:

```bash
mkdir build_ios
cd build_ios
cmake .. -G Xcode \
-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=armv7\;armv7s\;arm64 \
-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.0 \
-DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
-DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity"
```

Replace `/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity` with the actual path to your local copy of BasisUniversalUnity.

This will generate an Xcode project called `basisu_transcoder.xcodeproj`.

Open it with Xcode and build target `ALL_BUILD` or `basisu` with scheme `Generic iOS device`. Setting this scheme ensures that a fat-library is built and you don't run into linker errors due to missing symbols/architectures.

After this was successful, build the target `install`.

### Android

#### Prerequisites Android

- Android NDK

#### Build for Android

Create a subfolder `build_android_arm64`, enter it and call CMake like this:

```bash
mkdir build_android_arm64
cd build_android_arm64
cmake .. \
-DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DANDROID_NDK=/path/to/your/android/sdk/ndk-bundle \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/path/to/your/android/sdk/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
-DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity"
```

Replace `/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity` with the actual path to your local copy of BasisUniversalUnity.

Replace `/path/to/your/android/sdk/ndk-bundle` with the actual path to your Android NDK install.

To build and install

```bash
make && make install
```

Repeat these steps for other [Android platforms/ABIs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis) you want to support (armeabi-v7a and x86 are supported by Unity at the moment) by changing the `-DANDROID_ABI` parameter.

### Windows

I used the CMake GUI to configure (with Visual Studio 2017 community). Configure and build it twice. Once for platform `x64` and once for `win32` (which is the default).

Via command line (untested):

```batch
mkdir build_win32
cd build_win32
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity" -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x86
```

And again for 64-bit:

```batch
mkdir build_win64
cd build_win64
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity" -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64
```

### Linux

Make sure you have all packages installed for developing (depends on your distribution). Building is quite similar:

```bash
mkdir build_linux
cd build_linux
cmake .. \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity"
```

For cross compiling a 32-bit library (on a 64-bit system) use the provided toolchain:

```bash
mkdir build_linux_32
cd build_linux_32
cmake .. \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/linux_i686.toolchain.cmake \
-DBASIS_UNIVERSAL_UNITY_PATH="/your/path/to/BasisUniversalUnity"
```
